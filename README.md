## C++ Scripts

### some ceres examples:

- use [x,y,z, qx, qy, qz, w] to refine IMU and GT_board extrinsics
- **objectBA** solve camera transformation with $P_1$ and $$P_2$$  [x,y,z]
- **objectBA** solve camera transformation $T_{statics}$ with $P_1$ and $$P_2$$  [x,y,z] and estimate moving points' transformation $T_{moving}$
